# Azure Upgrade

> This skill handles **assessment and automated upgrades** of existing Azure workloads from one Azure service, hosting plan, or SKU to another — all within Azure. This includes plan/tier upgrades (e.g. Consumption → Flex Consumption), cross-service migrations (e.g. App Service → Container Apps), and SKU changes. It also covers **Azure SDK for Java source-code modernization** (e.g. legacy Java `com.microsoft.azure.*` → modern `com.azure.*`). This is NOT for cross-cloud migration — use `azure-cloud-migrate` for that.

## Triggers

| User Intent | Example Prompts |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Upgrade Azure Functions plan | "Upgrade my function app from Consumption to Flex Consumption" |
| Change hosting tier | "Move my function app to a better plan" |
| Assess upgrade readiness | "Is my function app ready for Flex Consumption?" |
| Automate plan migration | "Automate the steps to upgrade my Functions plan" |
| Modernize legacy Azure Java SDK | "Migrate legacy Azure SDKs for Java", "Upgrade legacy Azure Java SDK", "Migrate my Java project from com.microsoft.azure to com.azure" |
| Migrate Azure Cache for Redis (ACR/OSS) to Azure Managed Redis (AMR) | "Migrate my Redis cache to AMR", "ACR to AMR", "OSS to AMR", "Upgrade my Premium P2 cache to Managed Redis", "Pick an AMR SKU", "Convert my Redis IaC template to AMR" |
| Migrate Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise (ACRE) to Azure Managed Redis (AMR) | "Migrate my Enterprise_E10 cache to AMR", "ACRE to AMR", "Update my ACRE IaC template for AMR", "Migrate EnterpriseFlash to AMR", "Migrate my geo-replicated Enterprise Redis" |

## Rules

1. Follow phases sequentially — do not skip
2. Generate an assessment before any upgrade operations
3. Load the scenario reference and follow its rules
4. Use `mcp_azure_mcp_get_azure_bestpractices` and `mcp_azure_mcp_documentation` MCP tools
5. Destructive actions require `ask_user` — [global-rules](references/global-rules.md)
6. Always confirm the target plan/SKU with the user before proceeding
7. Never delete or stop the original app without explicit user confirmation
8. All automation scripts must be idempotent and resumable

## Upgrade Scenarios

| Source | Target | Reference |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Azure Functions Consumption Plan | Azure Functions Flex Consumption Plan | [consumption-to-flex.md](references/services/functions/consumption-to-flex.md) |
| Legacy Azure Java SDK (`com.microsoft.azure.*`) | Modern Azure Java SDK (`com.azure.*`) | [languages/java/README.md](references/languages/java/README.md) |
| Azure Cache for Redis (ACR/OSS) Basic/Standard/Premium | Azure Managed Redis (AMR) | [services/redis/redis-to-amr.md](references/services/redis/redis-to-amr.md) |
| Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise (ACRE) / Enterprise Flash | Azure Managed Redis (AMR) | [services/redis/redis-to-amr.md](references/services/redis/redis-to-amr.md) |

> SDK upgrade scenarios (e.g. Java legacy → modern) run a **source-code modernization flow** that is distinct from Azure service/plan/SKU upgrades: follow the scenario reference, **not** the Steps below.

> No matching scenario? Use `mcp_azure_mcp_documentation` and `mcp_azure_mcp_get_azure_bestpractices` tools to research the upgrade path.

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mcp_azure_mcp_get_azure_bestpractices` | Get Azure best practices for the target service |
| `mcp_azure_mcp_documentation` | Look up Azure documentation for upgrade scenarios |
| `mcp_azure_mcp_appservice` | Query App Service and Functions plan details |
| `mcp_azure_mcp_applicationinsights` | Verify monitoring configuration |

## Steps

1. **Identify** — Determine the source and target Azure plans/SKUs. Ask user to confirm.
2. **Assess** — Analyze existing app for upgrade readiness → load scenario reference (e.g., [consumption-to-flex.md](references/services/functions/consumption-to-flex.md))
3. **Pre-migrate** — Collect settings, identities, configs from the existing app
4. **Upgrade** — Execute the automated upgrade steps (create new resources, migrate settings, deploy code)
5. **Validate** — Hit the function app default URL to confirm the app is reachable, then verify endpoints and monitoring
6. **Ask User** — "Upgrade complete. Would you like to verify performance, clean up the old app, or update your IaC?"
7. **Hand off** to `azure-validate` for deep validation or `azure-deploy` for CI/CD setup

Track progress in `upgrade-status.md` inside the workspace root.

## Next

After upgrade is validated, hand off to:
- `azure-validate` — for thorough post-upgrade validation
- `azure-deploy` — if the user wants to set up CI/CD for the new app
